# PyCity Schools Analysis

This PyCity Schools data includes information of 15 high schools with varying school types (District vs. Charter), school sizes, budgets, and academic performance. Based on the data, the following conclusions can be drawn:

### District Summary:
Data shows relatively strong performance in reading, but with notable room for improvement in math. The percentage of overall passing students suggests that while many students are succeeding, a significant portion is falling behind, especially in math.

### Budget Allocation and Academic Outcomes:

While charter schools tend to have a lower budget per student, their students perform at a higher level in both math and reading, as well as in overall passing rates. This suggests that the per-student budget may not be the sole determinant of academic success.

Conversely, while district schools generally have slightly higher per-student budge ranging from $628 to $655, this additional funding does not seem to translate into better academic performance. This might point to potential inefficiencies in the way resources are being allocated or used in district school.

### School Size and Academic Outcomes:

Larger schools (those with 2,000+ students) tend to have lower overall academic performance, with overall passing rates between 52% and 54%. These schools, such as Bailey High School and Hernandez High School, also have lower passing rates in math and reading. 
Medium-sized schools (1,000-2,000 students) such as Cabrera High School and Griffin High School show higher academic outcomes, with passing rates above 90% and significantly better performance in both math and reading. 
Small schools (less than 1,000 students) like Holden High School and Pena High School also have high academic performance, with passing rate are 90% or higher.

### School Type and Academic Outcomes:

Charter schools outperform district schools in nearly every category. Charter schools have higher passing percentages in both math and reading. For example, charter schools have 94%-97% of students passing math and 95%-97% passing reading, whereas district schools have passing rates in math between 65%-68% and in reading between 80%-81% and so Charter schools also have significantly higher overall passing rates (ranging from 89% to 91%) compared to district schools (ranging from 52% to 54%).

### Conclusion:

Clearly, Charter schools tend to have better academic outcomes even with lower per-student funding. This could indicate that charter schools may be utilizing their resources more efficiently. 
District schools on the other hand are struggling with lower passing rates, particularly in math and overall performance, despite generally having slightly higher per-student budgets. This could signal that district schools may need to focus on improving math and overall curriculum effectiveness.
